            <h3>Study Session</h3>
            <div class="p">We are hosting a study session on [date] for underclassmen STEM majors 
                to learn from upperclassmen NOBCChE members who have experience with those STEM classes. 
                We will focus on general chemistry (CHEM 101 and 102), analytical (CHEM 241), and organic (CHEM 261 and 262) 
                specifically but feel free to show up with questions about other STEM courses as we may be able to help!</div>

                to get to know each other and chat in an informal setting. There is going to be food and 
                refreshments for everyone to enjoy while socializing! We will also have a jeopardy game at 
                the end to brush up on some chemistry topics and the history of UNC-Chapel Hill's chapter of

            <h3>General Body Meetings</h3>
            <div class="p">There will be general body meetings held weekly on Thursdays at 6:30pm where 
                all NOBCChE members, prospective members are encouraged to join as well, will meet to 
                discuss chapter bylaws, event planning, professional development opportunities, and planned 
                study sessions throughout the semester. These meetings help us determine what events are most 
                useful for undergraduate students and what times work best for those events. </div>
